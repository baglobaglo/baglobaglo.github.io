  <h3>Part B: </h3> </br>
   </br>
  <p>
    The most common elevator features i use must be buttons for the different floors. This is always </br>
    the case no matter how many floors there are or what type of elevator. Other than that, </br>
    I frequently use the close/open door button. This depends on how fast or slow the doors </br>
    open or closes. I have never used the alarm/telephone button in an elevator, luckily. </br>
    I rarely find myself using other features/buttons as well. </br>
    Based on my typical use, and what i would expect in an levator, the interface lets me use </br>
    these features easily. </br> </br>
    
    With this interface it is quite straight forward. You would typically press the button </br>
    with the number of your floor, and then maybe press the close elevator door button. Thats it. </br>
    The elevator support the user by having a clean and simple interface. No random "cool" button </br>
    feature to confuse the guests. It also have a more or less standard interface, so people </br>
    who have used elevator before know what to do. (universal elevatur "rules"). </br>
    The elevator provids feedback with both sounds and visuals. Depending on what features you use. </br>
    More about feedback was also mentioned in part C. </br>
    
    Luckily , there are not many mistakes you can make with a interface like this. </br>
    But as i wrote in part C, there are two button that seems to be an "alarm" button. </br>
    I think one of the buttons perhaps is to contact the hotel/reception(?) and the other is to </br>
    call the alarm sentral. But i dont know. It is not as intuitive or clear as i whould ecpect it to be. </br>
    If you are in an elevator and need help, you would likely contact the alarm sentral, and not the reception </br>
    i can imagne. </br> Also, having a star beside the number "1" on the button does not give any </br>
    reason for why that should be the reception/main floor. </br> </br>
    
    Based on some of these feedbacks and thoughts about the desing. I have made a sketch </br>
    with some fun and different ideas. This is not necessarily the perfect solution, but its fun to </br>
    try something different than what you would normally find when you have a project like this. </br> </br>
    
<h4> Sketch idea: </h4> </br>
    
    <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98468200/192600481-aedd97ac-2bf8-478d-bd0f-6fc8721cc16a.jpg" width=500 height=600>

    <p> Agian, not the perfect solution. This is to answer some of the things i have pointed out in C and B. I was thinking of an interface </br>
      where the guests can get an idea/visual representation of what they can find and except from the elevator. There is also a plan that an elevator will </br>
      follow you as you move up and down in the hotel. From the sketch i also tried to show that the buttons should have some sound and visual feedback. </br>
      I put all the buttons I found necessary in a alignment to the left, and the hotel sketch to the right. I removed the two alarm/telephone buttons and made just one alarm button. </br>
I think this is simpler and cleaner.  </br> </br> </br>
