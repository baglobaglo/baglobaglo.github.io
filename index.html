<h4>Issues with the current design and why is it good/bad?</h4>
  <p>
    The design gives no information to the guest regarding what you can find in the different floors. (Rooms, amenities etc..) </br>
This is not a problem in itself and it is not a big and complex hotel, but it could be a beneficial and nice feature to have. </br> </br>

The buttons turns red when they are pressed. The color red could in some cases potentially give the guests </br>
association with something being wrong or not working. On the other hand, there are atleast some visual and sound feedback </br>
for the guests. Both when we press buttons (sound and visuals), but also when the elevator arrives at the intended floor. </br> </br>

When you press the open - and/or close door button, it does not show a color, unlike many of the other buttons </br>
You dont neccesary expect these kind of button to give much feedback, but when they have panels to the right </br>
of them, like the other buttons, you would expect them to give som visual feedback like the other buttons. </br>
These buttons are not used a lot, but its is nice to have a consistent interface. </br> </br>

We got both an alarm and telephone button. What button does what? There is a small and short explanation </br>
text above the buttons, but that only describes the telephone icon. When should you press what button? </br>
Not necessarily intuitive. </br>

Overall, it is a clean and simple interface. it got the most essential and preferred featrues (from my point of view). </br>
It does what a elevator is supposed to do, it does it without to much "thinking", so it is quite intuitive and well structered. </br>
Nice use of alignment and contrasts, we got sign for blind people and the buttons in general are low centered so people in wheelchairs or other </br>
disabilities can access it with ease. </br> </br>
Even though this interface works fine, i will show some other fun ideas and different improvements in part B and part A.

  <h3>Part B: </h3> </br>
   </br>
  <p>
    The most common elevator features i use must be buttons for the different floors. This is always </br>
    the case no matter how many floors there are or what type of elevator. Other than that, </br>
    I frequently use the close/open door button. This depends on how fast or slow the doors </br>
    open or closes. I have never used the alarm/telephone button in an elevator, luckily. </br>
    I rarely find myself using other features/buttons as well. </br>
    Based on my typical use, and what i would expect in an levator, the interface lets me use </br>
    these features easily. </br> </br>
    
    With this interface it is quite straight forward. You would typically press the button </br>
    with the number of your floor, and then maybe press the close elevator door button. Thats it. </br>
    The elevator support the user by having a clean and simple interface. No random "cool" button </br>
    feature to confuse the guests. It also have a more or less standard interface, so people </br>
    who have used elevator before know what to do. (universal elevatur "rules"). </br>
    The elevator provids feedback with both sounds and visuals. Depending on what features you use. </br>
    More about feedback was also mentioned in part C. </br>
    
    Luckily , there are not many mistakes you can make with a interface like this. </br>
    But as i wrote in part C, there are two button that seems to be an "alarm" button. </br>
    I think one of the buttons perhaps is to contact the hotel/reception(?) and the other is to </br>
    call the alarm sentral. But i dont know. It is not as intuitive or clear as i whould ecpect it to be. </br>
    If you are in an elevator and need help, you would likely contact the alarm sentral, and not the reception </br>
    i can imagne. </br> Also, having a star beside the number "1" on the button does not give any </br>
    reason for why that should be the reception/main floor. </br> </br>
    
    Based on some of these feedbacks and thoughts about the desing. I have made a sketch </br>
    with some fun and different ideas. This is not necessarily the perfect solution, but its fun to </br>
    try something different than what you would normally find when you have a project like this. </br> </br>
