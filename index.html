<h4>Information regarding the different parts of my interface:</h4>
  <p> I have focused much more on the actual p5.js sketch and not the drawn sketch</br>
  Therefore, the drawn sketch is just a simple idea I had in the start, which I used as foundation for my p5 sketch </br>
  The sketch idea was to have REAL weather data, clock(time and date), sleep information, <br/>
  a To do list, and a simple "light soruce" from the mirror ceiling. </br>
  I know i could have implemented news and calender, but once i proved that i could do API calls </br>
  with the weather data (see code), i feal it only was time consuming to do the same with news and calander. </br>
  (This is a design course more than a p5.js programming course.) </br> </br>
  The interface has a simple bubble-button interaction which makes sure the user can decide what information </br>
  he/she wants to display at a time. The bubbles can be moved around after hitting the EDIT button on the top left </br>
  While the edit button is active the bubble-buttons do no work. Below I will talk about my features. </br> </br>
  
  Weather bubble: </br>
  This bubble gives you information about the CURRENT weather and the forecast for the next three days to come. </br>
  The information is given in a fun and simple text with clouds and a sun to give the interface some life. </br>
  The current weather and weather forecast are real actual data that gives information about Lubbock. Check it out!
  </br> </br>
  Clock bubble: </br>
  The clock bubble gives you the analog time, digital time and date. The analog time is done with inspiration from the web, </br>
  and the rest is just for simple good information. 
  </br> </br>
  Sleep bubble: </br>
  The sleep bubble is to give the user personal information about their sleep habit. </br>
  The information gives total hours and % of sleep (more and less). Notice how the information is </br>
  viewd to give the user a cool interaction with the mirror insted of plain white text in the middle of the mirror </br>
  </br> </br>
  ToDo-list bubble: </br>
  Simple and clean bubble in the top right corner to show the different tasks the user has to do. </br>
  Nothing more nothing less. 
  </br> </br>
  Light source bubble: </br>
  The last bubble is the bubble that shows you the light source. The light source is represente by a rectangle at the top </br>
  which is like a normal light source you would typically have above your mirror at home. </br>
  The color can be changed by the button all the way to the top right. (This was not to well shown in the video, i am sorry). </br>
  
  </br> </br>
  Overall very fun project, but VERY time consuming and more diffucult regarding the programming compared to what we have done in class. </br>
  But still, fun.
