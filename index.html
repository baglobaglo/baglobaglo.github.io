<h4>Issues with the current design?</h4> </br>
  <p>
    The design gives no information to the guest what you can find in the different floors. </br>
The buttons turns red when they are pressed. The color red could in some cases potentially give the guests </br>
association with that something being wrong / not working. </br>
When you press the open - and/or close door button, it does not show a color, unlike any of the other buttons </br>
You dont neccesary expect these kind of button to give much feed back, but when they have panels to the right </br>
of them, like the other buttons, you would expect them to give som visual feedback like the other buttons. </br>
We got both an alarm and telephone button. What button does what? There is a small and short explanation </br>
text above the buttons, but that only describes the telephone icon. When should you press what button? </br>
Not necessarily intuitive.
</p> </br> </br>

<h4> Why is it good/bad ? </h4> </br>
<p>
  Gives visual and sound feedback. Overall clean and simple. Got the most essentials </br>
It is not a big and complex hotel, but some visual information about the hotel/floor could be beneficial(?).
  Good with alignments, contrasts. We got signs for blind-people. Relativley low centered buttons for people in </br>
wheelchair can press the buttons.
